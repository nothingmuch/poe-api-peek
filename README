NAME
    POE::API::Peek - Peek into the internals of a running POE environment

DESCRIPTION
    POE::API::Peek extends the POE::Kernel interface to provide clean access
    to Kernel internals in a cross-version compatible manner. Other
    calculated data is also available.

    My intention is to provide massive amounts of internal data for use in
    POE debugging.

WARNING
    This version of this module is certified against POE version 0.38 and
    above. It will fail on any other POE version.

    Further, this module requires perl v5.6.1 or above.

METHODS
  new
      my $api = POE::API::Peek->new();

    Returns a blessed reference. Takes no parameters.

  id
      my $foo = $api->id();

    Obtain the unique id for the kernel. Takes no parameters. Returns a
    scalar containing a string.

KERNEL UTILITIES
  is_kernel_running
      if($api->is_kernel_running) {
          # do stuff...
      }

    Tell if the POE Kernel is running and active. Returns 1 if the Kernel is
    running and 0 if it is not.

  active_event
      my $event = $api->active_event();

    Get the active event name. Returns a string containing the event name.

  kernel_memory_size
      my $size = $api->kernel_memory_size();

    Get the memory footprint of the kernel and consequently the entire POE
    environment. See the Devel::Size documentation for several caveats
    involved in this metric.

  event_list
      my $events = $api->event_list();

    Gets the list of events for the whole POE environment. Returns a hash
    with the session IDs as the keys and a list of events as the values.

  which_loop
      my $loop_name = $api->which_loop();

    Tell which Loop POE has decided to use. Returns the string name of the
    Loop module.

    mandatory parameter, a POE::Session object which is the potential parent
    session this method will interrogate. Takes one optional parameter, a
    POE::Session object which is the session whose parentage this method
    will determine. If this parameter is not specified, it will default to
    the currently active session. Returns a boolean.
